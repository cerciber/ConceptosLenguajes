Personal notes on structures, functions and different languages.

Over the years that I've been a programmer, I've collected a huge number of code snippets of everything I've learned and categorized them in such a way that you can access them whenever you need them.

I have categorized them into:
- General purpose languages.
- Markup languages.
- Database languages.
- Dedicated purpose languages.
- Other languages.

I have collected snippets from many languages like: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, Python, C, C++, Java, Mathlab, SQLlite, MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle SQL.
